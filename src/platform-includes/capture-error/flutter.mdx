<PlatformContent includePath="capture-error/dart.mdx" />

- Flutter-specific errors, such as using `FlutterError.onError`, are captured automatically
- For Flutter <3.3, the SDK runs your init `appRunner` callback in a custom error zone, using [`runZonedGuarded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/runZonedGuarded.html) to automatically record errors not caught by flutter.
- Starting with Flutter 3.3, the SDK uses [`PlatformDispatcher.onError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onError.html) to automatically record errors not caught by flutter.
