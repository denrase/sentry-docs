<PlatformContent includePath="capture-error/dart.mdx" />

- Flutter-specific errors, such as using `FlutterError.onError`, are captured automatically
- Errors not cuaght by Flutter will be automatically recorded by the SDK using the [`PlatformDispatcher.onError`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-ui/PlatformDispatcher/onError.html) callback. For Flutter versions lower than 3.3, the `AppRunner` you provide on init will be run inside a custom zone using [`runZonedGuarded`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/runZonedGuarded.html) to records errors.
