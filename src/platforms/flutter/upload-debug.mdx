Debug symbols provide information that Sentry displays on the **Issue Details** page to help you triage an issue. We offer a range of methods to provide Sentry with debug symbols.

## When to Upload

With default settings, complete stack traces are available in your Dart error, out of the box, unless you use [`split-debug-info`](https://flutter.dev/docs/perf/app-size#reducing-app-size) and [`obfuscate`](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/obfuscate). In those cases, you need to upload the debug information files generated by the `flutter` build, so Sentry can show you proper stack traces.

<Note>

For Flutter Desktop (Windows/macOS/Linux) `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags are not supported yet. See this [issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/issues/433).

</Note>

Errors raised from the native layer in Flutter apps require certain debug information files to be uploaded. For example, an Android app can use `proguard` for minification and obfuscation. And when using NDK, dwarf debug files need to be uploaded. Flutter Web requires sourcemaps and iOS apps also require dwarf debug information files.

## Automatically Upload Debug Symbols

The most straight forward way is to [use the Sentry Dart Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart-plugin), which uploads debug symbols automatically for you.

### Install

In your `pubspec.yaml`, add `sentry_dart_plugin` as a new dev dependency.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  sentry_dart_plugin: ^1.0.0
```

### Build

The `flutter build apk`, `flutter build ios` (or _macos_) or `flutter build web` is required before executing the `sentry_dart_plugin` plugin, because the build spits out the debug symbols and source maps.

### Run

```bash
flutter packages pub run sentry_dart_plugin
```

## Manually Upload Debug Symbols

### Uploading for iOS and macOS

Sentry requires a dSYM upload to symbolicate your crash logs. The symbolication process unscrambles Appleâ€™s crash logs to reveal the function, file names, and line numbers of the crash. [Learn how to upload the dSYM files](/platforms/apple/dsym/).

If you use the `split-debug-info` and `obfuscate` flags, you need to upload the `*.dSYM` files instead of the `*.symbols` files generated by the Flutter build. The `*.dSYM` files are located in the `build` folder of your project and not the given `split-debug-info` folder.

### Uploading for Android NDK

The NDK symbols are uploaded by the Sentry Dart Plugin as well.

If you are using `sentry_flutter` version earlier than 5.1, native symbolication on Android requires a specific configuration. Refer to [Troubleshooting](/platforms/flutter/troubleshooting/) for more information.

<Note>

Sentry's Flutter SDK doesn't currently support the `uploadNativeSymbols` flag from the [Sentry Gradle Plugin](/platforms/android/gradle/).

</Note>

### Uploading with ProGuard

To use ProGuard with Sentry, upload the [Android Proguard/R8 mapping files](/platforms/android/proguard/) by either the recommended method of using our Gradle integration or manually by using [sentry-cli](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload). This is optional, and only needed if you have ProGuard (`minifyEnabled`) enabled.

### Uploading Source Maps for Flutter Web

The Sentry Dart plugin uploads source maps as well. You can also use our CLI to [upload source maps for Flutter Web](/product/cli/releases/#managing-release-artifacts).
